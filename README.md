# Waste-Tracker

This application uses pyRAPL to track the electricity used by your computer during its idle time.
Keep in mind that since this is built on pyRAPL, it will only work on Linux operating systems at the moment! 
My next plan moving forward is to consolidate the code into a proper application, which will be more easily accessible than a collection of files.
